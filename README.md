# ircify
Forked from the no longer maintained code, the code will still remain public domain without a license.

This code requires an unreleased library that is not part of this source to compile properly..
To quote the original ReadMe.. Its pretty much useless for anyone that does not have the said library..

You can find updated binaries on https://eggy.cc/ircify/ 
Note: support for this ircify is still very limited as it may break at any moment due to the unreleased library not being maintained.
